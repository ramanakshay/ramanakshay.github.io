title: Hierarchical CLIP-based Image Geolocation Prediction
description: Trained a CLIP-inspired image geolocation model that predicts the precise location of an image taken anywhere on earth. Designed a novel inference approach based on hierarchical feature clustering which achieves comparable performance while being ~100x more efficient than previous methods.
