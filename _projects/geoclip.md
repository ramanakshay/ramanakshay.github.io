title: Scalable CLIP-based Geolocation via Hierarchical Embedding Search
description: Developed a CLIP-based geolocation model trained on over 4M+ images from the MediaEval-16 dataset, achieving 70% country-level prediction accuracy. Engineered a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm to accelerate model inference by ~100x, reducing the search space from 100k+ GPS points to ~1k while maintaining competitive accuracy.
