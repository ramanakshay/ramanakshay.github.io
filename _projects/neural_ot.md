title: Solving Optimal Transport using Deep Neural Networks
subtitle: Project under Prof. Augusto Gerolin, Undergraduate Thesis
description: Developed gradient-based DNN appoximators to solve the optimal transport problem for high-dimensional data. Aimed to study application of OT in Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study dissociation of atoms.
