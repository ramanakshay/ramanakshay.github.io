title: Solving Optimal Transport using Deep Neural Networks
subtitle: Project under Prof. Augusto Gerolin, Undergraduate Thesis
description: Prototyped a deep neural network solver for amortized Wasserstein OT in TensorFlow, accelerating the Sinkhorn algorithm by 2x on MNIST. Simulated atomic dissociation for N-electron systems using an OT solver, predicting potential energy curves within 5% of theoretical values.
