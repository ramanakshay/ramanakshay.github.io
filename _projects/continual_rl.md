title: Continual Learning for Policy Gradient Methods
subtitle: Masters Capstone Project
description: Developed novel incremental learning algorithms to train reinforcment learning agents on a variety of real-world environments. Modified batch-wise policy gradient methods using eligibility traces to eliminate data buffers, particularly for long horizon tasks.
