title: Continual Credit Assignment with Eligibility Traces
subtitle: Masters Capstone Project
description: Developed an online reinforcement learning algorithm by adapting Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) with eligibility traces, eliminating memory-intensive data buffers. Proposed a clipped traces regularization method to solve training instability in the online setting, and applied on MuJoCo and Atari environments.
