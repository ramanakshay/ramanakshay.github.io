title: End-to-End System for Interpretable Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
description: Implemented an EfficientNet model in TensorFlow to classify Diabetic Retinopathy, achieving robust performance on a noisy and imbalanced medical dataset of retinal images. Deployed a complete end-to-end system as a Flask web application, integrating Grad-CAM to generate visual heat-maps that assist diagnosis and ensure model interpretability.
