title: Fine-Tuning Video Diffusion Models for 3D-Consistent Multi-view Generation
description: Fine-tuned a video diffusion model (SVD) to generate geometrically consistent, multi-view renderings from a single input image. Demonstrated that a curated high-quality 1% subset (10K objects) of the Objaverse dataset achieved performance comparable to full-scale training (1M+ objects).
