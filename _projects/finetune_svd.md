title: Finetuning Video Diffusion Models for Multi-view Consistency
description: Fine-tuned a video diffusion model to generate multi-view consistent object renderings from single-view inputs. Demonstrated that a curated high-quality 1% subset (10K objects) of the Objaverse dataset achieved performance comparable to full-scale training. (1M+ objects).
