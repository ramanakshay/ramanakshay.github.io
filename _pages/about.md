Hi! I'm a second-year master's student studying computer science at NYU Courant. My research interests broadly span reinforcement learning, efficient DNN computing, and ML in healthcare.

Currently, I am working on multimodality and data curation methods as a researcher at the Data, Intelligence, Computation in Engineering (DICE) lab @ NYU Tandon, advised by Prof. Chinmay Hegde.

In my spare time, I enjoy music, running, and reading.
