Hi! I am Akshay Raman, a recent graduate in Computer Science from New York University. My research interests broadly span reinforcement learning, multimodal learning, and the scientific applications of AI.

I am currently a researcher at the <a href="https://www.ai4vslab.org/">AI4VS Lab</a> at Columbia University, where I work under the supervision of Prof. Kaveri Thakoor. My current research focuses on multimodal learning approaches that integrate eye-tracking data for improved predictive performance. Previously, I had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at the <a href="https://chinmayhegde.github.io/lab/">DICE Lab</a> at NYU and the <a href="https://agerolin.github.io/">AI4Science Group</a> at the University of Ottawa.

In my spare time, I enjoy music, running, and reading.

You can find my CV <b> <a href="cv">here</a></b>.
